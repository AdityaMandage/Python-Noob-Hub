# Python-Noob-Hub
A place where beginner python programmers can post their projects and learn from each other! If you are new to programming, python, or the world of open source, this is where you want to be!

You can upload your projects to this repository, view others projects and learn from them to further improve your code and become the programmer you want to be! The rules fro this repo are listed below:
1: Your project must be inside its own folder to keep it from mingling with others, or this repo would be nothing but a jumble of nonsense python files!
To find out how to make a repo folder, visit this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository
2: There is no limit to the size of your project, but I would refrain from submitting a pull request if your project could not be understood by a person on a beginner to intermediate level. We want everyone to learn from this repo, not get confused by technical jargon beyond their understanding!
3: It is not required, but commenting your project code is encouraged to make your thought process clear to everyone.

I hope you go far from the knowledge this repo will give to you!
