# DECISION REVIEW SYSTEM

This project is a review-based system which is used in one of the most popular sports of the world, **Cricket.**

 **DRS** (Decision Review System) is basically a reviewing system which is used by **Third Umpires**. Third Umpires are those who watch the game from a specific room on a screen. His job is to take those decisions which are tough for On-field umpires. So, the on-field umpire passes the DRS to the Third Umpire when they are in a doubtful situation. Then, the third umpire watches the clip particular to that incident and then by looking from different camera angles and watching it in slow motion, he comes to the conclusion whether the batsman is out or not out. If the decision given by the third umpire is **Out**, then he has to go back to the pavilion. And if the third umpire gives **Not Out**,  then the batsman will stay there and will continue his batting. 

 DRS is particularly used for these conditions :

 1) Run-Out
 2) LBW
 3) Stumping
 4) To see if the catch was dropped
 5) To review the boundaries if there was a close call

Now, in this project, I have taken only **Run Out** into the consideration.

# Technologies I used to create this project

```
Python
tKinter
OpenCV
imutils
Threading

```

## Installation


You can either fork this repo or download the ZIP File and then open it in your code editor. 
Before that, you need to have Python installed in your system.

## Step - 1

> Note - **Avoid this step if you already have your python installed in your system.**


If you don't have Python installed in your system, then download it from here - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you downloaded the Python, then install it in your system.
Then open your command prompt or any command-line interpreter
which is available in your system. And then type this command:

```
    python --version

```

It will show you the version of python which you have downloaded
from the official website of Python.

So, now your system is ready to run Python programs.

## Step - 2

Now open your code editor. And Open it to that particular folder
where you have either forked my repo or downloaded the ZIP file. 
If you have downloaded it, then make sure to unzip it.

Once you did that, then go to the terminal and move on to that folder
where you have stored this project. 

> Note - I have used VS Code for this project. If you're using some other editor or an IDE then make sure you have installed all the python dependencies. Take the help of Google if you find any issues related to it.

## Step - 3

Install Virtual Environment if you need. Avoid it you don't want. 
It's not super necessary in this project. But if you need then head 
over to this [Documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## Step - 4

Now after doing all the above stuff, go to your terminal in that particular
folder only and install these modules. These modules are necessary
to run the project in your system.

```
    pip install opencv-python

```

```
    pip install pillow

```

```
    pip install imutils

```

## Step - 5

Now your system and editor are fully ready to run this project.
So, now run this project and your canvas will open with this interface.


# Running Tests

Once you see the canvas interface, choose the option according to
your choice, and will get the required output.
